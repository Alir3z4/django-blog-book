# Django Blog

Creating Web sites is fun, it's so great that we do whatever we can to learn how to do it. We developers love doing it no matter what.

Python is a language known for being easy to learn and ridiculously powerful. If you're reading this book, it means you have already made your decision and did your research about this wonderful language.

Django is complete full stack [mega] Web framework. It provides what so ever needed for developing almost any kind of Web sites and Web Applications. In some time and not much of hassle you can have a Web application up and ready without needing to spend lots of time on reinventing the wheels.

For this book I have chosen Django Web Framework to build a Blog with common features.
We assume you know basic Syntax of Python and have read [Django Official Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/tutorial01/).

Provided code and snippets are simple and self-explanatory and come with comment in the code as well as some DocString for code documentation that can be used for future code document generation via available tools such as [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) and others. The way of coding would be describing *what* and *why* we're doing that implementation in plain English.
