# Django Blog

Creating Web sites is fun, it's so great that we do whatever we can to learn how to do it. We developers love doing it, no matter what.

Python is a language known for being easy to learn and ridiculously powerful. If you're reading this book, it means you have already made your decision and did your research about this wonderful language.

Django is a full stack [mega] Web framework. It provides what so ever needed for developing almost any kind of Web sites and Web Applications. Without much of hassle you can have a Web application up and ready without needing to spend lots of time on reinventing the wheels, this is what makes Django different from others, it provides the requirement that you'll be spending many days to compare and find in other frameworks, such as it's Database ORM, Authentication, Session, Cookies, Admin, Database Migrations and many more.

For this book I have chosen Django Web Framework to build a Blog with common features.
We assume you know basic Syntax of Python and have read [Django Official Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/tutorial01/).
